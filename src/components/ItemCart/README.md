# Item Cart

_Tag_: **HTML**

Implement an item cart in HTML with the following static data:

| Item   | Price  | Quantity |
| ------ | ------ | -------- |
| Banana | $1.00  | 3        |
| Burger | $6.90  | 1        |
| Cookie | $4.20  | 4        |
| Total  | $12.10 | 8        |

Your HTML code should use a table with proper semantic markup and with Item Cart as its caption.
