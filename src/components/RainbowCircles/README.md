# Rainbow Circles

_Tag_: **CSS**

You're given an HTML file with three nested divs, each with a unique ID.

Using only CSS, style the HTML to have the appearance of six concentric colored circles.

From outside to inside, the circles should have the following characteristics:

- 300px by 300px, #ff0000
- 250px by 250px, #ffa500
- 200px by 200px, #ffff00
- 150px by 150px, #008000
- 100px by 100px, #0000ff
- 50px by 50px, #800080

While there are a variety of ways to achieve this desired output, for the purpose of this problem all colors
should be achieved using background colors and/or box model properties.
