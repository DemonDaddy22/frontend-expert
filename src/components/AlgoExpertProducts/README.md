_Tag_: **CSS**

You're given an HTML file containing divs representing AlgoExpert's products. Using only CSS, align the products in three rows following these specifications:

- The first row contains SystemsExpert and MLExpert, in that order.
  - SystemsExpert has a width of 50% of the width of the container, MLExpert has a width of 30% of the width of the container, and all of the remaining horizontal space is between them.
  - MLExpert has a height of 75px, and SystemsExpert is vertically centered in the row.
- The second row contains just AlgoExpert, which has a width of 75% of the width of the container and is horizontally centered.
- The third row contains FrontendExpert and ProgrammingExpert, in that order.
  - FrontendExpert has a width of 40% of the width of the container, and ProgrammingExpert takes up any remaining horizontal space, leaving 10px between the two products.
  - ProgrammingExpert has a height of 75px, and FrontendExpert hugs the bottom of the row.
- The three rows have 24px of vertical spacing between them. All other styles are either browser-default styles or styles from the starting code.
