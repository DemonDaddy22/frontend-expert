# useFetch

_Tag_: **React Hooks**

Write a `useFetch` custom hook that takes in a required `url` as a string or URL object. This parameter should be directly passed to the native JavaScript `fetch` function.

Calling `useFetch` in a component should make a fetch request when an instance of the component is mounted. Additionally, a new request should be issued on any render where the `url` has changed.

The `useFetch` function should return an object with three keys:

- **responseJSON**: The JSON response from the most recent call to `fetch`. If no response has been received yet or the most recent request resulted in an error, this should be null.
- **isLoading**: When a `fetch` request is issued, this should be set to `true`, and set to `false` when the response comes back or an error is thrown.
- **error**: If the most recent call to `fetch` threw an error or retrieving the JSON from the most recent response threw an error, the error should be saved in this value, otherwise it should be null.

In the event that the `url` changes before the previous `fetch` request returns, the response from that previous request should not be used in order to prevent a race condition.

### Sample Usage

```jsx
function Fetcher() {
  const { responseJSON, isLoading, error } = useFetch(url);
  const [url, setUrl] = useState('');
  return (
    <>
      <input value={url} onChange={(e) => setUrl(e.target.value)} />
      {error ? <p>Error: {error}</p> : isLoading ? <p>Loading...</p> : <p>Response: {responseJSON}</p>}
    </>
  );
}
```
