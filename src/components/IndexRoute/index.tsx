        Although I had already attempted the exercises on their coding platform, but for the sake of practising further, I thought of creating this
        simple website which is a collection of all the questions and their solutions. You can browse through the list of questions mentioned in the
        sidebar and open up any question to view further details.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the questions involve usage of certain APIs to fetch data and implement the solution, but due to CORS, their internal APIs are not
        accessible. I have explored and used some free alternatives here in order to implement the question. I have pointed out the same in such
        questions as well, but just in case I missed out on explicitly mentioning the API endpoints, you can open up the browser's console and head
        over to the network tab for more details.
