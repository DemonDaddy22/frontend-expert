        Although I had already attempted the exercises on their coding platform, but for the sake of practising further, I thought of creating this
        simple website which is a collection of all the questions and their solutions. You can browse through the list of questions mentioned in the
        sidebar and open up any question to view further details.

        Some of the questions involve usage of certain APIs to fetch data and implement the solution, but due to CORS, their internal APIs are not
        accessible. I have explored and used some free alternatives here in order to implement the question. I have pointed out the same in such
        questions as well, but just in case I missed out on explicitly mentioning the API endpoints, you can open up the browser's console and head
        over to the network tab for more details.
