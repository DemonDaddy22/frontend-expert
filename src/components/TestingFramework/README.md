# TestingFramework

_Tag_: **JavaScript**

Implement the following three functions of a basic JavaScript testing framework:

1. `describe` - This function defines a test suite of related test cases. It takes in a string `testSuiteName` and a callback `func`, which makes one or more calls to `it`.

2. `it` - This function defines a single test case in a test suite and is called within a `describe`'s callback `func`. It takes in a string `testCaseName` and its own callback `func`, which makes one or more calls to `expect`.

3. `expect` - This function defines a single check in a test case and is called within an `it`'s callback `func`. It takes in an arbitrary parameter `actual` and returns an object with the following three functions that are used to compare `actual` to other values:
   1. `expect(actual).toExist()`: This function checks that `actual` is neither `null` nor `undefined`.
   2. `expect(actual).toBe(expected)`: This function checks that `actual` is strictly equal to `expected`.
   3. `expect(actual).toBeType(type)`: This function checks that `actual` is of the type `type`, which can be any string returned by the `typeof` operator.

As a test suite and its test cases are executed, they should print the following strings:

```javascript
// When a test suite begins:
'beginning test suite {testSuiteName}';

// When a test suite successfully completes:
'successfully completed test suite {testSuiteName}';

// When a test case begins:
'beginning test case {testCaseName}';

// When a test case successfully completes:
'successfully completed test case {testCaseName}';

// When a test suite fails (because a check in one of its test cases fails):
'failed running test suite {testSuiteName} on test case {testCaseName} with error message {errorMessage}';

// When `expect(actual).toExist()` fails, `errorMessage` should be:
'expected value to exist but got {actual}';

// When `expect(actual).toBe(expected)` fails, `errorMessage` should be:
'expected {actual} to be {expected}';

// When `expect(actual).toBeType(type)` fails, `errorMessage` should be:
'expected {actual} to be of type {type} but got {typeOfActual}';
```

When a check fails, the following things should happen:

1. The relevant `expect` function should throw the appropriate `errorMessage`.
2. The relevant `it` function should throw an arbitrary error, and its execution should stop.
3. The relevant `describe` function should print the failure string with `console.error` (all other strings should be printed with `console.log`), and its execution should stop.

For the sake of simplicity:

- All output strings should be in lowercase letters, with no punctuation whatsoever.
- No modifications should be made to `testSuiteName` and `testCaseName` values (they shouldn't be lowercased).
- When `actual` and `expected` values are printed within error messages, they should be stringified with `JSON.stringify()`.

Note that this question's tests naturally check that `console.log` and `console.error` are correctly called; this means that debugging your solution with `console.log` will unavoidably make your solution fail some tests.

### Sample Usage #1

```javascript
describe('Passing Test Suite', () => {
  it('Passing Test Case #1', () => {
    expect('foo').toExist();
    expect(1 + 1).toBe(2);
  });

  it('Passing Test Case #2', () => {
    expect({}).toBeType('object');
  });
});
```

### Sample Output #1

```javascript
// Console logs:
beginning test suite Passing Test Suite
beginning test case Passing Test Case #1
successfully completed test case Passing Test Case #1
beginning test case Passing Test Case #2
successfully completed test case Passing Test Case #2
successfully completed test suite Passing Test Suite
```

### Sample Usage #2

```javascript
describe('Failing Test Suite', () => {
  it('Passing Test Case', () => {
    expect(0).toBe(0);
  });

  it('Failing Test Case', () => {
    expect(true).toBe(true);
    expect(true).toBe(false);
  });

  it('Unreachable Test Case', () => {
    expect('foo').toBe('bar');
  });
});
```

### Sample Output #2

```javascript
// Console logs:
beginning test suite Failing Test Suite
beginning test case Passing Test Case
successfully completed test case Passing Test Case
beginning test case Failing Test Case
// Console errors:
failing running test suite Failing Test Suite on test case Failing Test Case with error message expected true to be false
```
