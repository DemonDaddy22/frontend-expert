# Signup Form

_Tag_: **HTML**

Implement a sign-up form in HTML with the following six input fields, each with an appropriate label:

1. **Username**, a required text input field
2. **Password**, a required password input field
3. **Email**, a required email input field
4. **Phone Number**, an optional telephone input field
5. **Date of Birth**, an optional date-picker input field
6. **I agree to the TOS**, a required checkbox input field

There should also be a Sign Up button at the bottom of the form. When clicked on (and if all required fields have been filled), the button should submit the form using default browser behavior.
