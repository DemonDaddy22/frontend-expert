# Blog Post

_Tag_: **HTML**

You've been provided with a blog post as raw text, and you need to convert this post into a properly marked-up HTML file.

The post should have a primary heading of `Introducing AlgoCoin` with a tagline of `The future of decentralized meme currency is here.`.

The post should be treated as an article with two sections, titled `What is AlgoCoin?` and `Where Do I Start?`, respectively. Each section should have a paragraph of text (the text directly below the respective section title in the starting code), and the sections should be divided by a horizontal rule.

In the first section, the text `proof-of-inverted-binary-tree consensus algorithm` should be marked up as strong text, and `Web 4.0` should be emphasized. In the second section, the word `AlgoExpert` should be a link to <https://algoexpert.io>, and it should open in a new tab.

Finally, the post should have a footer at the bottom with the text `Copyright 3022 AlgoCoin. All rights reserved.`.

Your HTML code should use proper semantic markup.

Content for the sections can be found below:

Section 1

```Text
AlgoCoin utilizes a revolutionary proof-of-inverted-binary-tree consensus algorithm that will absolutely transform the way we think about currency and catapult the metaverse to its next major stage: Web 4.0. Using AlgoCoin is simple. Instead of hoarding capital in wallets with forgotten passwords, earn AlgoCoin at the time of usage through our unique point-of-sale system. Each inverted binary tree equates to one AlgoCoin. This means if your chicken tenders cost 420 AlgoCoin, all you need to do is invert 420 binary trees.
```

Section 2

```Text
Getting started with AlgoCoin is as easy as reversing a linked list. We recommend starting out by practicing on AlgoExpert. Next, once you feel you can invert binary trees as well as an Ex-FAANG 10x engineer, it's time to ditch your fiat currency and enter the future.
