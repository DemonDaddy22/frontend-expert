**Frontend-Expert** contains bunch of exercises available in the [FrontendExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/frontend/product) course. All the implementations have been done in ReactJS for consistency. A CI/CD pipeline will be setup soon and exercises done up till that point can be easily viewed as a part of the deployed website. Detailed description can be found in each exercise's README.

## Exercises

2. [ItemCart](./src/components/ItemCart/README.md): Implement an item cart in HTML with static data.
3. [Spaghetti Recipe](./src/components/SpaghettiRecipe/README.md): You've been provided with a recipe for spaghetti as raw text, and you need to convert this recipe into a
